# The Humanoid Landscape

## Learning Objectives
- Identify key characteristics and design principles of humanoid robots.
- Recognize major research institutions and companies in humanoid robotics.
- Understand current capabilities and future challenges for humanoids.

## Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Humanoid robots are machines designed to resemble and mimic the human body, including the head, torso, arms, and legs. Their primary advantage lies in their ability to operate in environments built for humans, using tools and interfaces designed for human anatomy.

## Current State of Humanoid Development

### Leading Humanoid Robots

**Boston Dynamics Atlas**
- Advanced bipedal locomotion with dynamic balancing
- Impressive parkour and mobility capabilities
- Strong focus on dynamics and control algorithms
- Research-oriented, not yet commercialized

**Honda ASIMO**
- Pioneer in humanoid robotics since the 1980s
- Smooth bipedal walking and stair climbing
- Human-scale form factor (130 cm tall)
- Early influence on the field, production ended in 2018

**Tesla Bot (Optimus)**
- Focus on general-purpose manipulation for manufacturing
- Tall humanoid design (173 cm) for warehouse environments
- Integration with AI and machine learning
- Early prototypes in development

**Unitree H1**
- Compact humanoid with impressive mobility
