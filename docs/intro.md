# Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Course Overview
This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the exciting and rapidly evolving field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Over 13 weeks, you will explore foundational concepts, practical applications, and advanced topics, culminating in a capstone project.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:
- Understand the core principles of physical AI and embodied intelligence.
- Develop and simulate robot behaviors using ROS 2 and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
- Implement advanced control and perception techniques for humanoid robots.
- Explore the integration of vision-language models for intelligent robotic interaction.

## Module Overview
This course is structured into five main modules, plus foundational concepts and a hardware appendix:

- **Foundations**: Introduction to Physical AI, Digital-to-Physical Systems, Humanoid Landscape, Sensor Systems.
- **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Architecture, Nodes/Topics/Services, Packages, Launch Files, URDF.
- **Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation**: Gazebo, URDF/SDF, Physics, Unity.
- **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Isaac Sim, Synthetic Data, Isaac ROS, NAV2.
- **Module 4: Humanoid Robot Development**: Kinematics/Dynamics, Bipedal Locomotion, Manipulation, Human-Robot Interaction.
- **Module 5: Vision-Language-Action**: Conversational Robotics, Whisper, LLM Planning, Capstone.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Workstation, Edge Computing, Robot Lab Options.

## Hardware Summary
This course requires access to specific hardware for practical exercises, including an NVIDIA RTX GPU (4070 Ti or higher), Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, and optionally, a Jetson Orin Developer Kit and RealSense cameras. Information on various robot lab options (e.g., Unitree Go2/G1) is also provided.

## Assessment Overview
Your understanding will be assessed through a combination of programming assignments, project milestones, and a final capstone project.
